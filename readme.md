## üëæ Hi there, I'm Bruno! How are you doing?



‚ú® I've always been a great problem solver, passionate about technology and studying, and faced with a continuous search for learning and resources to solve the most varied problems, I ended up finding myself in the world of development. 

üßëüíª Today I work as a **Software Engineer**, working in the Back-End with the team in identifying problems and root cause to propose new solutions and features. :blue_heart:

:octocat:	 I'm also a mechanical engineer, a huge fan of Harry Potter ‚ö°Ô∏è and Star Wars üåë and more important with a heart in developing, wanting to learn more about back-end development being passionate about challenges, about contributing and wanting to make a difference!
